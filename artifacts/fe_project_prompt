Lets outline the requirements again:                                                                                                                   
   - A login page for users - that will accept a username and password for login, or sign up if its their first time                                      
   - For the design of the funds management app:                                                                                                          
     The design should be similar to high tech fintech dashboards, like RiseUp or Moneytor.                                                               
     - The landing page after the login will be the 'Home' tab (from the left side panel) that will show the following charts:                            
       - Upper part block: Net Income card, cash flow card (representing income minus payments of the provided timeline), and on the right side, the
         filters for the time frame (lets have both Quick like: last month, last 3 month, last 6 month and last year, and an exact date selection with start
         and end) We should set a maximum one year on the timeframe as this is the max allowed data pull of the scraping providers.
       - Main middle part block: Dashboards of - Pie chart of the categories totals from total transactions, trend graph of totals per month / day        
         according to the selected timeframe, and the top 5 recurring payments table with name, category and amount columns (if no recurring, meaning same payment style every month,
         not installments, we will not show anything)
     - There will be three tabs on the left side panel - Home, Accounts and Logs                                                                          
       - Home - as described above                                                                                                                        
       - Accounts - A table showing the configured accounts that the user configured, and a button to Add new account. For each row we should be able to  
                    delete that account with another user notification for if he is sure he wants to delete this account. In addition there should be an edit option
                    that will allow editing the name, credentails etc for the specific account. Banks and credit cards accounts should have a different icon that will
                    resemble which account type it is. So if needed to add to the Account interface that property lets do it
       - Logs - A window showing application logging that will allow troubleshooting and understandings. We should allow persistent of logs for up to 3   
                month time
                                                                                                                                                          
Use MUI and best practice React and Node components so it will be easy to enhance and be modern with UI components.
Build strong UI architecture that will allow separate loading for components IF NEEDED, states that makes sense and separate files per domain (like
the home page, accounts etc)
                                                                                                                                                          
Show me you are a professional Frontend engineer just like you did for the Backend
