I want us to rethink and implement the whole categorization logic and flow as this is a crucial part of the system that should be optimized and well executed.

Category definition:
- Each category should have these attributes:
  - Name - string understand what was categorized by the system and what was his configuration, and allow us to have multi level categorization and abstraction
  - Keywords - list of strings that will be used as an 'exact match' on the description field of a transaction and define if the category should be attached to the transaction or not

Categories management:
- The categories tab
  - Shows a table of existing categories with their name and keywords
  - Allows to add new categories, edit existing ones and sync such that existing transactions will be reevaluated with the categories logic.
  - On a category edit save, this should be the only categroy that is 'auto' evaluated on all transactions, so in general the Sync categories button is redundant and can be removed - the update process will take place automatically when creating a new category or editing an existing one and only on that category 

Categorization flow in case of scraping:
  Any new transaction that is being added via the scrape process, should be categorized according to the existing categories logic.
  A transaction could have multiple categories attached, so we might need to update the Transaction entity.
  Each category applied to a transaction, should also hold metadata so the system will know if it was automatically/manually attached to the transaction (for example if a user explicitly decides a transaction description should be categorized as his selection regardless of the categories configured keywords), and allow the display of all categories attached to a transaction.

  Since every edit or addition of a category involves in a 're evaluate' process of all transactions, this process should be async. 
  On a category name change, we should make sure only the new category name is attached and we don't have left overs of the old name.
  On a category keywords change, we should reevaluate if the transaction's description has an 'exact match' for the category configured words, and remove the regex like behavior of categorization
