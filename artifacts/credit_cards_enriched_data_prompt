For credit cards and other scrapers, we could possibly enrich our per transaction data even more, with more information and categorization done by each vendor.

I want to be able to define additional fields for each specific vendor.
Currently I see we have the BankTransaction model that defines the scraping results, but since credit cards or others might have additional data, maybe we can it as a parent model for more 'Transactions' like models that are relevant for other sources, like CreditCardTransaction etc that might be enriched with more information.

So we want to be able to:
- Understand what additional information is fetched from credit card vendors (we will do it gradually, so lets start with the isracard CompanyId)
- Have a parent class for TransactionBase, and have the BankTransaction inherit from it and CreditCardTransaction as well with the general additional information being parsed (the vendor specific categorization etc)
- Have a 'per scraper' specific handling if required and the specific TransactionBase model that is fetched from the scraping
- An abstract method that will allow to have a specific business logic that should eventually help in categorizing the transaction regardless of its source, but that will utilize all available information from the scrape

Be meticolous, get the data required from remote repository or specific vendors API documentation, show me the plan and the additional available scraping information before we execute.
Be precise, architect-like minded and expert engineer that thinks about expansion, generalization and proper methodology for such a broad and important project
